				<text><![CDATA[<p>If we have two complex numbers <span class="math inline">\(z=a+i b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w=c+i d\)</span> then, as we already know <span class="math inline">\( z+w=(a+c)+i(b+d)\)</span> that is, the real parts add together and the imaginary
    parts add together. But this is precisely what occurs with the addition of two <span><strong>vectors,</strong> which we will cover elsewhere but the process is quite natural<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\underline{p}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\underline{q}\)</span> are 2-dimensional vectors then: <span class="math inline">\[
\underline{p}=a \underline{i}+b \underline{j}\qquad \underline{q}=c \underline{i}+d \underline{j}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\underline{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\underline{j}\)</span> are unit vectors in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-
    and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-directions respectively. So, using vector addition: <span class="math inline">\[\underline{p}+\underline{q}=(a+c) \underline{i}+(b+d) \underline{j}\]</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We conclude from this that addition (and hence subtraction) of complex numbers is essentially equivalent to addition (subtraction) of two-dimensional vectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, complex numbers (when represented on an Argand diagram) are <strong>slidable</strong> â€” as long as you keep their length and direction the same, you can position them anywhere on an Argand diagram. We see that the Cartesian form of a
    complex number: <span class="math inline">\(z=a+i b\)</span> is a particularly suitable form for addition (or subtraction) of complex numbers. However, when we come to consider multiplication and division of complex numbers, the Cartesian description
    is not the most convenient form that is available to us. A much more convenient form is the polar form which we now introduce.<br></p>]]></text>
