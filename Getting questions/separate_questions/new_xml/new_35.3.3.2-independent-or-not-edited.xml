<p></p><p>Decide which of the following pairs of events (\(A\) and \(B\)) arising from the experiments described are independent.<br></p><ol><li>One card is drawn from each of two packs.<br>

\(A=\) a red card is drawn from pack \(1\).<br>

\(B=\) a picture card is drawn from pack \(2\).<br>
\(A\) and \(B\) are [[1]]</li>
<li>A manufacture of cutting tools sources synthetic diamonds from two laboratories:<br>\(A=\) the quality of the diamonds sourced from lab A meet the required specifications.<br>\(B=\) the quality of the diamonds sourced from lab B meet the required specifications.<br>\(A\) and \(B\) are [[1]]</li>

<li>Two boxes contains 20 nuts each, some have a metric thread, some
have a British Standard Fine (BSF) threads and some have a British
Standard Whitworth (BSW) thread. A nut is picked out of each box.<br>

\(A=\) a nut picked out of the first box is BSF.<br>

\(B=\) a nut picked out of the second box is metric.<br>
\(A\) and \(B\) are [[1]]</li>
<li>A box contains 20 nuts, some have a metric thread, some have a

Whitworth (BSW) thread. Two nuts are picked out of the box.<br>

So events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent.</li><li>The nuts are sampled from different boxes, so \(A\) and \(B\) are independent events.</li><li>The nuts are sampled from the same box <em>without replacement</em>. The means that the probability that the second nut is metric will differ if the first sampled nut was or was not a metric nut. Therefore, events \(A\) and \(B\) are dependent.</li></ol></p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><br></p>]]></text>
