        <name>19.1.2.3 Arbitrary Constants in a Differential Equation</name>
        <questiontext>&lt;p&gt;We have seen that an expression including one arbitrary constant required one differentiation to obtain a differential equation which eliminated the arbitrary constant. Where two constants were present, two differentiations were required. Is the converse true? For example, would a differential equation involving &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; as the only derivative have a general solution with one arbitrary constant and would a differential equation which had &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; as the highest derivative produce a general solution with two arbitrary constants? The answer is, usually, yes.&lt;/p&gt;</questiontext>
