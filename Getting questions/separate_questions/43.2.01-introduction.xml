While medical researchers might be interested in knowing the answers to questions such as `Is age
related to blood pressure?' engineers might be interested in knowing the answers to questions such
as `Is the shear strength of a weld related to its diameter?' or `Is the rate of wear of a petrol engine
related to its operating temperature?' Hopefully you remember from the Regression section, statisticians measure the strength of a relationship between two variables by using a quantity called the correlation coefficient. As you might expect, tests exist which allow us to interpret the meaning of a calculated correlation coefficient.</questiontext>
